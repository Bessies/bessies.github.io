  <div>This is my first paragraph. I wonder if I'm supposed to include the paragraph tag inside of or outside of the division tag. Does it matter? I wish I knew. I feel like this paragraph should be long enough that I have a real sense of what a div tag does. Did I mention there's nothing in this activity to give me any idea of what it does? It says it's a generic container for content, and it can be used for grouping things, but I don't really know what that means.</div>

  <div>Will this be a new column? Or will there be a new section on the page? It's so mysterious and intriguing! I don't know what to expect. I guess that makes it more fun? Do we think this paragraph is long enough? Will it be obvious what's happening with this division? I assume I can identify what a div is in my CSS? Can I create more than one kind of div in a document? So many questions, but I suppose I'm getting ahead of myself. <a href="http://www.google.com" target="_blank">Go to Google</a>
